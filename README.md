# Daily-Planner

In this project I created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.The purpose of this project was to highlight the use of: Moment.js, local storage and the JavaScript 'this' keyword. 

An error I saw with the starter code, was the colour palette used in css for the the time blocks. The use of red and green of similar tonality would be difficult for someone with colour blindness to tell the difference between, so I altered the colours with the use of http://web-accessibility.carnegiemuseums.org/design/color/ to make a more accessible colour palette.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* JQuery
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* Moment.js Library

## Criteria that I met to achieve this

* When the user opens the planner, the current day is displayed at the top.
* When the user scrolls down, they are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
* When the user views the timeblocks, they are colour coded to whether they are in the: past, present or future.
* When the user clicks on a timeblock they can enter an event.
* When the user clicks on the save button of the timeblock, then the computer saves the text for that event in local storage.
* When the user refreshes the page, then the saved events persist.
